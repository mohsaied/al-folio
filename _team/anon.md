I am looking for strong/motivated PhD super-students who want to change the way we design computer systems.
Feel free to get in touch with me if you are applying to the Cornell [ECE PhD program](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/graduate-programs/phd-program/phd-admission-process).
Also, mention my name in your statement of purpose if you want me to consider your application.

My group is located in the New York City Cornell Tech Campus, however, Cornell has a single PhD admissions system as described [here](https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/phd/phd-studies/).
