I am looking for motivated students who are interested in deep learning systems and/or reconfigurable computing.
Feel free to email me with the subject line *"prospective student"* if you are applying to the Cornell [ECE PhD program](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/graduate-programs/phd-program/phd-admission-process).
Please mention my name in your statement of purpose if you would like me to consider your application.

Prerequisites: Must have a strong **desire to learn** and an **ambition** to change the way we do computing!

My group is located in New York City at Cornell Tech, however, Cornell has a single PhD admissions system as described [here](https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/phd/phd-studies/).
