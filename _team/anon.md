I am looking for motivated students who are interested in deep learning systems and/or reconfigurable computing.
Feel free to email** me with the subject line *"prospective student"*, and include your (1) CV, (2) transcript and (3) some rough thoughts on what you are interested in researching during your PhD.
When you are applying to the Cornell [ECE PhD program](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/ece/programs/graduate-programs/phd-program/phd-admission-process), please mention my name in your statement of purpose if you would like me to consider your application.

Prerequisites: Must have a strong **desire to learn** and an **ambition** to change the way we do computing!

A strong candidate will have demonstrated:

1. Academic excellence: High grades and ideally ranked within the top 5 of their class from a reputable undergraduate institution.
1. Research potential: A publication (in-progress is fine) at a top-tier conference or involvement in a significant research project.

My group is located in New York City at Cornell Tech, however, Cornell has a single PhD admissions system as described [here](https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/phd/phd-studies/).


** Note: I thought I can keep up with email but I have been proven wrong. I literally receive hundreds of emails every year from prospective students. If I don't reply to you, please don't take it personally and don't be discouraged from applying to Cornell.
