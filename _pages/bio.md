Mohamed Abdelfattah is an Assistant Professor at Cornell Tech and in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Cornell University. His research interests include deep learning systems, automated machine learning, hardware-software codesign, reconfigurable computing, and FPGA architecture. Mohamed’s goal is to design the next generation of machine-learning-centric computer systems for both datacenters and mobile devices.

Mohamed received his BSc from the German University in Cairo, his MSc from the University of Stuttgart, and his PhD from the University of Toronto. His PhD was supported by the Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship and he received three best paper awards for his work on embedded networks-on-chip for FPGAs. His PhD work garnered much industrial interest and has since been adopted by multiple semiconductor companies in their latest FPGAs. After his PhD, Mohamed spent time at Intel’s programmable solutions group, and most recently at Samsung where he led a research team focused on hardware-aware automated machine learning.
