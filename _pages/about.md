I am with [Samsung AI Center Cambridge](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge) researching the interplay between machine learning algorithms and computer architecture.

More about me: I did my PhD with [Prof. Vaughn Betz](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~vaughn) at the University of Toronto, where I proposed the addition of an embedded Network on Chip to modern FPGAs -- 5 years later, [Xilinx](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3293908) announced adopting embedded NoCs for their FPGAs and [Achronix](https://www.achronix.com/product/speedster7t/) followed suit.

Even more about me: After finishing my PhD, I worked for 3 years at Intel, building both [software and hardware](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit) for a deep neural network accelerator on FPGAs.
