  <p> I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University and Cornell Tech. I hold a BSc from the German University in Cairo, an MSc from the University of Stuttgart and a PhD from the University of Toronto. I am also a Research Consultant at the <a href="https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge">Samsung AI Center, Cambridge</a>. </p>

My research group is defining the next generation of deep-learning-based computations.
We study methods to co-design and co-optimize neural networks and the hardware on which they run.
Our goal is to enable efficient deep learning in both mobile devices and datacenters by: (a) scrutinizing computations done during data acquisition, preprocessing, neural network training/inference, post-processing, (b) developing methods to optimize deep learning for different hardware and (c) designing hardware to run deep learning computations efficiently.
We have a special interest in reconfigurable computing using devices like FPGAs.
